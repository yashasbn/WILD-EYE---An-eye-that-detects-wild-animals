**Project Description: WILD-EYE - An Eye that Detects Wild Animals**

**Overview:**
WILD-EYE is an advanced computer vision project aimed at detecting wild animals in various environments using state-of-the-art object detection techniques. The project leverages the power of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), a cutting-edge real-time object detection algorithm, to accurately identify and classify wild animals from images and video feeds. This technology can be applied in wildlife conservation, monitoring, and safety systems to enhance the detection and tracking of wild animals.

**Problem Statement:**
The increasing need for efficient and accurate wildlife monitoring systems is critical for conservation efforts, research, and ensuring human-wildlife coexistence. Traditional methods of wildlife monitoring often involve manual observation, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in scope. WILD-EYE addresses these challenges by providing an automated, real-time solution for detecting and classifying wild animals.

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of wild animals, which includes six different classes. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is specifically designed for training and evaluating object detection models.

**Technologies Used:**
- **YOLOv8:** State-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm used for training the model and detecting wild animals.
- **Python:** Primary programming language used for model training, data preprocessing, and script development.
- **OpenCV:** Library used for image and video processing.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Deep learning frameworks used to implement and train the YOLOv8 model.
- **Kaggle:** Platform used for dataset sourcing and initial data exploration.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment used for interactive data analysis and model development.

**Key Features:**
